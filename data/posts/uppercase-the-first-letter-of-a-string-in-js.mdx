JavaScript offers many ways to capitalize a string to make the first character uppercase. Learn the various ways, and also find out which one you should use, using plain JavaScript.

## `chartAt` + `slice`

The first way to do this is through a combination of `cartAt()` and `slice()`. With `chartAt()` uppercases the first letter, and with `slice()` slices the string and returns it starting from the second character:

```javascript
const name = 'codax';
const nameCapitalized = name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);
// expected output: "Codax"
```

You can create a function to do that:

```javascript
const capitalize = (s) => {
  return s.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + s.slice(1);
};

capitalize('codax'); // "Codax"
```

## `replace`

My favorite is with `replace()` because I love regex (even if I'm not an expert) and regex is more customizable in general.

```javascript
const name = 'codax';
const nameCapitalized = name.replace(/^\w/, (c) => c.toUpperCase()));
// expected output: "Codax"
```

You can also make it a function:

```javascript
const capitalize = (s) =>
  return s.replace(/^\w/, (c) => c.toUpperCase()));
}

capitalize('codax'); // "Codax"
```

## Conclusion

For readability, I recommend the first option (`chartAt` + `slice`), and for speed, I recommend the second option (`replace`).
