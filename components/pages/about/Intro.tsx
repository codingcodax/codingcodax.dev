        Hey there! I‚Äôm Alexis, a self-taught developer exploring wha{"'"}s
        possible on the web.

      <Text lineHeight='relaxed' css={{ mb: '$20' }}>
        I like to spend my time building projects that interest me, as well as
        pushing myself to learn more through open source projects and share my
        knowledge with other developers.

        What I‚Äôve been up to
      </Heading>
      <Text lineHeight='relaxed' css={{ mb: '$20' }}>
        I{"'"}ve been recently focused on building React (specifically Next.js)
        applications, using popular tools such as Chakra UI and to help me bring
        my designs.

        Interests
      </Heading>
      <Text lineHeight='relaxed' css={{ mb: '$5' }}>
        I{"'"}m currently interested in building tools that help us make things
        faster and more efficient.
      </Text>
      <Text lineHeight='relaxed' css={{ mb: '$5' }}>
        I{"'"}m also really into Design Systems and Component Driven User
        Interfaces and I love to explore the tools and techniques that help to
        create more scalable and maintainable UI{"'"}s.
      </Text>
      <Text lineHeight='relaxed' css={{ mb: '$5' }}>
        When I{"'"}m not coding (or writing or reading about it) you
        {"'"}ll typically find me engaging with another creative or engaging
        activity such as design, gaming, curating playlists, solving rubik{"'"}s
        cube or getting lost in series!
      </Text>
      <Text lineHeight='relaxed' css={{ mb: '$20' }}>
        Although I love to keep myself busy with activities, I make sure to set
        aside to going for walks and runs.
